How to Run:
Run a make command and the executable will be ./test
It will prompt the user to pick 1 or 2, to encode or to decode.
  Picking 1 will prompt for .ppm file to use.
  Then it will ask for a file to use as for input text.
  Then it asks where the .ppm file with the encoded message will be saved as.

  Picking 2 will prompt for a .ppm with an encoded message in it.
  Then it will decode it and show the output before it saves it, just to ensure it reads correctly.
  Then it will ask where it should be saved and written into.

  Picking a false number will cause an error message and terminate the program.


To work on this assignment, we decided the best way to do it was to meet together in real life on Thursday the 17th and meet on Discord Friday the 18th. Overall it took some preplanning and some trial and error. But once we started moving through it, we started making great progress. 
We shared the work by having me (Sam) start the repo and actual push the code. We did this on both days and then we individually tested the code on our terminals and I tested it on the lab computers.
It's been tested on the lab computers and our personal terminals with no errors.

One of the first problems that we ran into was the repo itself. It took us making three different repos before we were able to get it working as a collaboration.

The biggest issue was trying to get the files set up as tests, but after reaching out to the teacher, we found an easier way to test and it has now been fixed.
